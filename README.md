In this project we aim to protect the driver from any possible danger.
We included the ULTRASONIC SENSOR in order to show the driver the objects which are in safe distance and we attached a buzzer in order
to provide an alarm the driver if any object comes in the near proximity of the vehicle.

Often we came across news regarding accidents in blackspot regions.
In order to tackle that situation we attached a sound sensor. There will be a sound source at blackspot and we code the sound sensor in a such a way
that it will show a "BLACKSPOT NEARBY" message when blackspot will be a certain distance from the vehicle.

We make use of PIR SENSOR in order to sense the motion of the objects in a safe distance and accordingly alter the speed of the motor and it will also show 
a led regarding any object motion is detected in the near proximity of the vehicle.

In order to address the problems in the vehicle itself we included gas and temperature sensor.
If there is any leakahge in the gas tank of the vehicle then it makes an buzzer sound and red light pops up in the dashboard regarding it.

If the temperature of the engine lies in a certain range then it will not create any problem but if it gets increases than a certain point (it may be due to the
unavailibillity of the coolant or any other reasons) then it may create a mishapp for the driver. In order to tackle the situation we used the temperature sensor.
